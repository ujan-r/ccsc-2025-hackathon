*pan to Ujan walking around the circle outside Collier-Scripps*
*ambient birds chirping*

Ujan: Man, I really need a printer! I have to turn in this paper in ten minutes!

*printer falls from the sky, crushing Ujan with a giant explosion*

*Narrator (Evan?) walks in from offscreen (green screen)*
Narrator: Wouldn't it be nice if the world worked like this? While Ujan might have some hospital bills, he did get a printer when he needed it. And as a bonus, everyone else on campus has access to a hot new printer too! (turns to the side) Alas, we don't live in such a world...

*video rewinds to before the printer falls*

(Ujan: Man, I really need a printer! I have to turn in this paper in ten minutes!)

*Declan walks on screen, being at nerdy as possible*
Declan: Have you tried using A-star to search for printers in nearby buildings?

Ujan: No, bu-

Declan (interruupting): What about scraping the Drake IT API?

Ujan: I don't think we have acces-

Declan: Maybe you don't, but their security really isn't that good...

*Nick walks onto the scene, holding his laptop*
Nick: Well, have you heard of $APP_NAME? It'll help you find the nearest printer on campus, in addition to many other useful devices! Let me show you.

*Nick and Ujan walk over to the nearest table, sitting down; Nick opens his laptop*

(Nick improv an explanation of the product)

Ujan: Thank you so much! You're a lifesaver. I love this project!
